**Examination Middleware** is a robust, secure, and automated bridge designed to streamline the digitization and submission of physical examination answer sheets to the Moodle Learning Management System (LMS). It acts as an intelligent intermediary between the physical examination hall and the digital grading environment.

## ⚠️ Recent updates (2026-01-12)

The codebase has received several maintenance and UX updates to improve safety, auditing and staff workflows. Highlights:

- New maintenance scripts:
   - `setup_username_reg.py` — upsert a single Moodle `username -> register_number` mapping. Useful to seed or correct mappings used during student login and pending-list authorization. Example:

      ```bash
      # interactive
      python setup_username_reg.py

      # direct
      python setup_username_reg.py --username 22007928 --register 212222240047
      ```

   - `setup_subject_mapping.py` — interactive workflow to find an assignment by course-module-id (CMID) in Moodle, create or update a `SubjectMapping`, and optionally fix existing artifacts that reference the wrong assignment id.

- Staff UI changes:
   - `app/templates/staff_upload.html` now contains a Reports modal (view/resolve/edit/delete reports) and improved listing behaviour.
   - The `Total Uploaded` stat is computed from the visible (non-deleted) artifacts returned by the listing endpoint, so the navbar count now matches the visible table ("Showing X of Y files").
   - Client-side behaviour was hardened: the student/staff login flows no longer call `localStorage.clear()`; only session keys are removed on logout.

- Backend/service changes (important for deploy and troubleshooting):
   - `app/services/artifact_service.py` was hardened to explicitly catch `IntegrityError` on DB flush/commit and to rollback safely. This reduces silent failures for duplicate transaction IDs.
   - `get_pending_for_student()` requires either a valid 12-digit `register_number` OR both `moodle_user_id` and `moodle_username`. This prevents ambiguous or leaking results when student identity is unclear.
   - Admin remediation: if a deterministic `transaction_id` collides with an existing (deleted/archived) artifact, clearing or nulling the `transaction_id` in the DB row will allow a re-upload. Use the `audit_logs` and `ExaminationArtifact` table to locate problematic rows before manual edits.

- API and client notes:
   - Staff UI attempts multiple common listing endpoints (e.g. `/api/upload/all`, `/upload/all`, `/api/artifacts`) to be resilient against different backend deployments. Prefer endpoints that return an array of `artifacts` for best UI compatibility.
   - Consider returning HTTP 409 for DB integrity conflicts (duplicate transaction / unique constraint) so the client can surface a clear message instead of a generic 500.

##  The Problem Statement

In academic institutions transitioning to digital grading, handling physical answer scripts presents significant logistical challenges:

1.  **Manual Labor**: Individually scanning, renaming, and uploading hundreds of answer scripts to specific Moodle assignments is time-consuming and inefficient.
2.  **Human Error**: Manual processes are prone to errors such as uploading the wrong file to a student's profile or mislabeling files.
3.  **Security & Integrity**: Direct database manipulation or unverified bulk uploads can compromise the chain of custody.
4.  **Student Verification**: Students often lack a mechanism to verify that their specific physical paper was scanned and submitted correctly before grading begins.

##  Proposed Solution & Architecture

This middleware solves these issues by decoupling the **scanning/uploading** process from the **submission** process, introducing a secure validation layer.

### Core Concept
The system utilizes a **3-Step "Upload-Verify-Push" Workflow**:
1.  **Bulk Ingestion**: Administrative staff upload bulk batches of scanned PDF/Images.
2.  **Intelligent Processing**: The system parses filenames (e.g., `123456_MATH101.pdf`) to extract the Student Register Number and Subject Code, automatically mapping them to the correct Moodle Assignment ID.
3.  **Student-Led Submission**: Students log in using their Moodle credentials. They view *only* their specific answer scripts and trigger the final submission to Moodle. This ensures non-repudiation and student verification.

### High-Level Architecture

    F -->|Token Exchange| E
```
## Database Schema Overview

The database is designed for data integrity and auditability. Key models include:

| Model | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`ExaminationArtifact`** | The core entity representing a scanned paper. Stores UUID, file path, hash (SHA-256), extracted metadata (Reg No, Subject), and current `WorkflowStatus` (e.g., `PENDING`, `SUBMITTED_TO_LMS`). |
| **`SubjectMapping`** | Configuration table mapping a Subject Code (e.g., `19AI405`) to a specific Moodle Course ID and Assignment ID. |
| **`StaffUser`** | Accounts for administrative staff authorized to perform bulk uploads. |
| **`StudentSession`** | Manages ephemeral student sessions. Stores encrypted Moodle access tokens used to perform submissions on behalf of the student. |
| **`AuditLog`** | A rigid ledger tracking every action (Upload, View, Submit) with IP addresses and timestamps to ensure a chain of custody. |
| **`SubmissionQueue`** | A buffer for handling Moodle API failures or maintenance windows, ensuring no submission is lost. |

## 🔄 Workflow of the Platform

### Phase 1: Administration & Setup
1.  **Mapping**: Admin configures the `SubjectMapping` table (e.g., Subject `CS101` targets Moodle Assignment `ID: 55`).
2.  **Scanning**: Examination cell scans answer sheets using the naming convention: `{RegisterNumber}_{SubjectCode}.pdf`.

### Phase 2: Staff Operations
1.  **Login**: Staff logs into the Staff Portal.
2.  **Bulk Upload**: Staff drags and drops folders of scanned files.
3.  **Validation**: The system instantly validates filenames. Invalid files are rejected; valid files are hashed and stored as `ExaminationArtifacts` with status `PENDING`.

### Phase 3: Student Operations
1.  **Login**: Student logs into the Student Portal using their university Moodle username and password.
2.  **Dashboard**: The system displays all papers tagged with their Register Number.
3.  **Review**: Student previews the PDF to ensure it is their paper.
4.  **Submit**: Student clicks "Submit".
    * *Backend Action*: The system authenticates with Moodle using the student's token.
    * *Backend Action*: Uploads the file to Moodle's draft area.
    * *Backend Action*: Finalizes the submission for grading.
5.  **Confirmation**: The status updates to `SUBMITTED_TO_LMS`.

## 🧪 Testing

### Test with Sample Files

1. Create test files with correct naming:
   ```
   611221104088_19AI405.pdf
   611221104089_ML.pdf
   ```

2. Login to Staff Portal with `admin`/`admin123`

3. Upload the test files

4. Login to Student Portal with Moodle student credentials and register number

5. View and submit papers to Moodle

### API Testing with cURL

```bash
# Staff Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/staff/login \
  -F "username=admin" \
  -F "password=admin123"

# Upload File (use token from login)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/upload/single \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@611221104088_19AI405.pdf" \
  -F "exam_session=2024SPRING"

# Health Check
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

## 📝 Workflow

1. **Staff uploads scanned papers** through the Staff Portal
2. **System extracts metadata** from filenames (register number, subject code)
3. **Papers are validated** and stored with unique transaction IDs
4. **Students login** with Moodle credentials and register number
5. **Students view** their assigned papers
6. **Students submit** papers directly to Moodle assignments
7. **System executes** 3-step Moodle submission:
   - Upload file to Moodle
   - Save submission draft
   - Submit for grading

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with 12 rounds
- **Token Encryption**: AES-256 (Fernet) for Moodle tokens
- **JWT Tokens**: Short-lived access tokens
- **File Validation**: Extension and size checks
- **Audit Logging**: All operations logged
- **CORS**: Configurable origin whitelist

## 🔄 Background Tasks (Optional)

For production deployment with Celery:

```bash
# Start Redis
redis-server

# Start Celery worker
celery -A app.tasks worker --loglevel=info
```

## 📈 Monitoring

- Health endpoint: `/health`
- Logs: `exam_middleware.log`
- Database audit table: `audit_logs`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Error
```
Ensure PostgreSQL is running and credentials in .env are correct
```

### Moodle Token Error
```
Verify MOODLE_ADMIN_TOKEN has required capabilities
Check Moodle external service configuration
```

### File Upload Failed
```
Check file size limits in Moodle
Verify assignment allows file submissions
```
